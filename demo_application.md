# demo-application

Weâ€™ve put together a working demo application to show in detail how our [design patterns](patterns.md) and [APIs](api_reference.md) can be used to build a font browsing interface.

You can see a [running example of this demo app](https://demo.typekit.io/) working in a browser, or [pull down the source code](https://github.com/typekit/platform-demo-browse) to take a closer look. The README explains how to install it for yourself and mentions relevant API endpoints and features.
