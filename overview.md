# Important note, please read me firstÔ∏è!

We are planning updates to the platform documentation, and are not currently accepting new integrations. Existing third-party integrations will continue to work while we bring things up to date.

# Getting started with Typekit Platform

The Typekit Platform is a combination of design advice, APIs, and assets provided by Adobe Typekit so that products and services can integrate Typekit to help people know, find, get, organize, and use fonts.

In addition, the Typekit Platform offers dramatically improved performance over our prior APIs. So, even if your product or service has already integrated Typekit, you can benefit.

The Typekit Platform comprises a set of RESTful APIs, exposing predictable, resource-oriented endpoints that enable deep integrations with desktop, mobile, and web apps. Client applications can implement font browsing, purchase, and sync workflows, as well as manage kits used to embed Typekit fonts in websites. The API supports HTTP standard verbs, headers, and status codes.
