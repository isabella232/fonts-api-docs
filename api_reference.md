# Overview

[View API Endpoint Documentation](http://docs.typekit.io/)

Our API is production ready, but you will need to [get in touch with us](mailto:support+partners@typekit.com) when you are ready to launch your integration. If you’ve used our APIs before, you may want to see our [legacy documentation](https://typekit.com/docs/api) as well.

Here, we maintain an assortment of resources and topics relevant to using the Typekit Platform API — some things you should know when getting into our code.
