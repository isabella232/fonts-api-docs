#API key

Unique key identifying the client application making the request. To get an API key, create an integration through the Console and add Typekit as a service. Youâ€™ll automatically get a developer key that you can use to start making API requests in development mode immediately. For more information on starting a new integration with Typekit, see our partnership section.
