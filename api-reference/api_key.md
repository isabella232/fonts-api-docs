#API key

Unique key identifying the client application making the request. To get an API key, create an integration through the [Console](http://adobe.io/console) and add Typekit as a service. Youâ€™ll automatically get a developer key that you can use to start making [API requests](http://docs.typekit.io/) in development mode immediately. For more information on starting a new integration with Typekit, see our [partnership section](partnership.md).
