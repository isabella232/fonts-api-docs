#Visual search region detection

The visual_search/regions endpoint accepts an image with any amount of text, along with a count of how many regions to return. Given this data, the Typekit API will identify up to ten text regions from an image and return their coordinates. You can use these coordinates to highlight regions and prompt users to choose a single region for visual search input.
