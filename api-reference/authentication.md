# Authentication

The Platform API supports both signed out and authenticated modes. When users are in the signed-out state, only the API key is required. You can authenticate as a user by sending a 'X-Typekit-Token' HTTP header.

If your integration aims to give users access to their Typekit accounts by signing in with an Adobe ID, youâ€™ll also need to integrate an [authentication component](https://www.adobe.io/authentication.html).
