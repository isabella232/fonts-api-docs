# Authentication

The Platform API supports both signed out and authenticated modes. When users are in the signed-out state, only the API key is required. You can authenticate as a user, send the standard OAuth 2.0 header: `Authentication: Bearer {user_token}`. To pass in your API key, add header `X-Api-Key: {Client ID}`. The latter is required always, the former only to call APIs in signed-in mode.

If your integration aims to make calls authenticated as a user, you can use the [authentication component](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/creativesdk/docs/websdk.html#!user-auth-ui.md) from the Creative SDK. To get access to the Creative SDK, use the [Console](http://adobe.io/console) to add it to your integration as a service along side Typekit. You can find more detailed instructions about OAuth integration in the [Adobe I/O Authentication Overview.] https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/AuthenticationOverview/AuthenticationGuide.md
