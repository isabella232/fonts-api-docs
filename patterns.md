# Design patterns

Our growing library of design patterns for the Typekit Platform explains the **reasoning** behind features we offer, and provides abstract **design guidance** based on our experience in working with many diverse integration partners.

**Patterns are not rules**. They represent our shared understanding of design solutions. Our understanding may change over time, especially with your feedback. Our patterns may also change, especially as our partnerships evolve.
